description: Always plan before coding with simple, phased iterations.

guidelines:
  - First, give a simple plan with clear phases (Phase 1, Phase 2, etc.).
  - Keep plans short and focused on the next immediate step.
  - Only code after the plan is approved.
  - If user says "just fix it," skip planning and code directly.
