  "guidelines": [
    "Prefer simple and readable code over clever or overly optimized code.",
    "Write code as if the next person maintaining it is a beginner.",
    "Avoid unnecessary abstractions, patterns, or indirection unless required.",
    "Optimize for clarity first; only optimize for performance if there's a proven bottleneck.",
    "Use established patterns only if they make the code more understandable.",
    "Default to explicitness rather than implicit magic (e.g., no hidden side effects).",
    "Document 'why' for non-obvious decisions, but prefer code that needs minimal comments.",
    "Small, composable functions are better than large, complex ones.",
    "Favor configuration simplicity over customization flexibility.",
    "Prioritize deleting unnecessary code before adding new features."
