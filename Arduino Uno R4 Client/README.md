# üìú Arduino UNO R4 ‚Äî Core Responsibilities

## Responsibility 1: Emergency System
- Monitor emergency input pin (interrupt-style monitoring)
- Trigger emergency mode with immediate state transition
- Send MQTT emergency message to `campus/security/emergency`
- Immediate unlock signal to servo Arduino when triggered
- LED feedback: Solid ON during emergency
- Auto-return to IDLE after emergency timeout (10 seconds)

## Responsibility 2: RFID Relay
- Monitor RFID input pin
- Generate mock RFID value
- Send RFID value to ESP32CAM via MQTT (`campus/security/rfid`)
- LED feedback: Quick blink

## Responsibility 3: Unlock Control
- Listen for unlock commands from API via MQTT (`campus/security/unlock`)
- Send unlock signal to servo Arduino
- LED feedback: Brief blink on unlock

## Responsibility 4: Motion Activation
- Monitor motion sensor input pin
- Change state in state machine

    [*] --> IDLE
    IDLE --> ACTIVE_WAITING: Motion Detected
    ACTIVE_WAITING --> ACTIVE_SESSION: RFID Detected
    ACTIVE_SESSION --> IDLE: Session Timeout (30s)
```
</div>

#### Interrupt Conditions
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    state "Any State" as ANY
    state EMERGENCY
    state ERROR
    
    ANY --> EMERGENCY: Emergency Button<br/>(Returns to IDLE after 10s)
    ANY --> ERROR: Connection Lost<br/>(Returns when recovered)
```
</div>
</div>

### State Descriptions
- **IDLE**: Low power, monitoring motion
- **ACTIVE_WAITING**: Full system active, waiting for RFID
- **ACTIVE_SESSION**: Processing authenticated session
- **EMERGENCY**: Immediate unlock, overrides all states
- **ERROR**: Connection/hardware issue recovery

### Emergency as an Interrupt
The emergency system operates as a high-priority interrupt that can trigger from any state:
- üîç **Constant Monitoring**: Emergency pin is always checked, regardless of current state
- ‚ö° **Immediate Response**: Instantly transitions to emergency handling
- üîÑ **Auto Recovery**: Returns to IDLE after 10-second timeout
- üö® **Priority**: Emergency checks take precedence over all other state operations

### IDLE State
- No motion detected
- Minimal power consumption
- LED: OFF
- Actively monitoring:
  - Motion sensor
  - Emergency input (high priority)

### ACTIVE_WAITING State
- Motion detected & Connected
- Full system functionality:
  - Monitoring RFID (send when detected)
  - Processing unlock commands
  - Emergency monitoring (immediate override)
- LED: Normal blink pattern
- Maintains WiFi & MQTT connections

### ACTIVE_SESSION State
- RFID detected and validated
- Session management active
- Timeout monitoring
- LED: Fast blink pattern
- Returns to ACTIVE_WAITING after session timeout

### ERROR State
- Connection or hardware issues
- Attempts automatic recovery
- LED: Error pattern (fast blink)
- Returns to IDLE after recovery
