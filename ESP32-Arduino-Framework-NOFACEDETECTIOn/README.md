# üìú ESP32-CAM ‚Äî Core Responsibilities

## Responsibility 1: Motion Detection & Face Processing
- Monitor motion sensor (or simulate motion triggers)
- Capture images when motion is detected
- Perform face detection using lightweight algorithm
- Convert captured JPEG to Base64 for transmission
- Subscribe to `/rfid` channel for RFID data reception
- LED feedback: Normal blink during processing

## Responsibility 2: Session Management
- Generate unique session IDs
- Combine face data with RFID status
- Create JSON payload with:
  - Session ID
  - Face data (Base64-encoded)
  - RFID status
  - Timestamp
  - Device identification
- Publish to MQTT channel `/session`
- LED feedback: Fast blink during active session

## Responsibility 3: Emergency Monitoring
- Monitor emergency channel via MQTT channel `/emergency`
- Immediate state transition on emergency
- Pause all face capture and session activities
- LED feedback: Solid ON during emergency
- Auto-return to IDLE after timeout (10 seconds)

## üîÑ State Machine Design

### Main Flow & Interrupt States
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; gap: 20px;">
<div>

#### Normal Operation
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> IDLE
    IDLE --> ACTIVE_WAITING: Motion Detected
    ACTIVE_WAITING --> ACTIVE_SESSION: RFID Detected<br/>& Face Detected
    ACTIVE_SESSION --> IDLE: Session Timeout (30s)
```
</div>
<div>

#### Interrupt Conditions
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    state "Any State" as ANY
    state EMERGENCY
    state ERROR

    ANY --> EMERGENCY: Emergency Signal<br/>(Returns to IDLE after 10s)
    ANY --> ERROR: Connection Lost<br/>(Returns when recovered)
```
</div>
</div>

### State Descriptions

#### IDLE State
- Low power mode
- Monitoring motion sensor
- LED: OFF
- Actively monitoring emergency channel

#### ACTIVE_WAITING State
- Motion detected & system active
- Periodic image capture and face detection
- Listening for RFID signal via MQTT
- LED: Normal blink pattern

#### ACTIVE_SESSION State
- Face detected and RFID data received
- Session payload construction and publishing
- 30-second timeout monitoring
- LED: Fast blink pattern

#### EMERGENCY State
- All normal operations paused
- 10-second timeout period
- LED: Solid ON
- Auto-returns to IDLE after timeout

#### ERROR State
- Connection/hardware issue recovery
- LED: Error pattern (very fast blink)
- Automatic recovery attempts
- Returns to IDLE when resolved
