# üìú ESP32-CAM ‚Äî Core Responsibilities

## Responsibility 1: Trigger on Motion Detection 
- Monitor motion sensor (or simulate motion triggers)
- LED feedback: Normal blink during processing
- Transitions system to active state

## Responsibility 2: Face Detection and Image Capturing
- Perform face detection using lightweight algorithm
- Capture the image when face is detected
- Convert captured JPEG to Base64 for transmission
- Note: Currently capturing images on motion detection only. Face detection will be implemented in a future milestone.

## Responsibility 3: Session Management
- Generate unique session IDs
- Subscribe to `/rfid` channel for RFID data reception
- Combine face data with RFID status
- Create JSON payload with:
  - Session ID
  - Face data (Base64-encoded)
  - RFID status
  - Timestamp
  - Device identification
- Publish to MQTT channel `/session`
- LED feedback: Fast blink during active session

## Responsibility 4: Emergency Monitoring
- Monitor emergency channel via MQTT channel `/emergency`
- Immediate state transition on emergency
- Pause all face capture and session activities
- LED feedback: Solid ON during emergency
- Auto-return to IDLE after timeout (10 seconds)

- Creating and sending session payloads
- Captures images every 3 seconds
- LED: Very fast blink (100ms)
- 3-second session timeout
- Transitions to IDLE on timeout
- Includes detection status in payload for API processing

#### EMERGENCY State
- All normal operations paused
- 10-second timeout period
- LED: Solid ON
- Auto-returns to IDLE after timeout

#### ERROR State
- Connection/hardware issue recovery
- Resets connection flags
- 5-second retry delay between attempts
- LED: Error pattern (very fast blink)
- Returns to IDLE when connections restored
