# üìú ESP32-CAM ‚Äî Core Responsibilities

## Responsibility 1: Trigger on Motion Signal from Arduino Mega
- Monitor input pin for motion signal from Arduino Mega.
- LED feedback: Normal blink during processing
- Transitions system to active state (CONNECTION)

## Responsibility 2: Face Detection and Image Capturing
- Perform face detection using lightweight algorithm
- Capture the image when face is detected
- Convert captured JPEG to Base64 for transmission
- Note: Currently capturing images on motion detection only. Face detection will be implemented in a future milestone.

## Responsibility 3: Session Management
- Generate unique session IDs
- Monitor input pin for RFID signal from Arduino Mega.
- Combine face data with RFID status (based on signal from Mega).
- Create JSON payload with:
  - Session ID
  - Face data (Base64-encoded)
  - RFID status
  - Timestamp
  - Device identification
- Publish to MQTT channel `/session`
- LED feedback: Fast blink during active session

## Responsibility 4: Emergency Monitoring
- Monitor emergency channel via MQTT channel `/emergency`
- Immediate state transition on emergency
- Pause all face capture and session activities
- LED feedback: Solid ON during emergency
- Auto-return to IDLE after timeout (10 seconds)

    IDLE --> CONNECTION: Motion Signal from Mega
    CONNECTION --> FACE_DETECTING: WiFi & MQTT Connected
    FACE_DETECTING --> RFID_WAITING: Face Detected or Timeout
    RFID_WAITING --> SESSION: RFID Signal from Mega or Timeout

    state "Any State" as ANY
    state EMERGENCY
    state ERROR

    ANY --> EMERGENCY: Emergency Signal<br/>(Returns to IDLE after 10s)
    ANY --> ERROR: Connection Lost<br/>(Returns when recovered)
    ERROR --> IDLE: Connection Restored
```

### State Descriptions

#### IDLE State
- Low power mode
- Monitoring input pin for motion signal from Arduino Mega.
- LED: OFF
- No WiFi or MQTT connections
- No image capture
- Transitions to CONNECTION on receiving motion signal from Mega.

#### CONNECTION State
- Motion signal received, establishing connections
- Attempts WiFi connection
- Attempts MQTT connection after WiFi
- LED: Slow blink (1000ms)
- 5-second retry delay between attempts
- Transitions to FACE_DETECTING when connected
- Transitions to ERROR if connections fail

#### FACE_DETECTING State (Updated)
- WiFi and MQTT connected
- Camera active, performing face detection
- LED: Normal blink (500ms)
- 10-second timeout period
- Transitions to RFID_WAITING on face detection OR timeout
- Logs face detection status for API processing
- Continues flow regardless of detection result

#### RFID_WAITING State (Updated)
- Face detected or timeout occurred
- Waiting for RFID signal on dedicated input pin from Arduino Mega.
- LED: Fast blink (200ms)
- 5-second timeout period
- Transitions to SESSION on receiving RFID signal OR timeout
- Logs RFID detection status for API processing
- Continues flow regardless of detection result

#### SESSION State (Updated)
- Face and/or RFID detection status recorded
- Creating and sending session payloads
- Captures images every 3 seconds
- LED: Very fast blink (100ms)
- 3-second session timeout
- Transitions to IDLE on timeout
- Includes detection status in payload for API processing

#### EMERGENCY State
- All normal operations paused
- 10-second timeout period
- LED: Solid ON
- Auto-returns to IDLE after timeout

#### ERROR State
- Connection/hardware issue recovery
- Resets connection flags
- 5-second retry delay between attempts
- LED: Error pattern (very fast blink)
- Returns to IDLE when connections restored
